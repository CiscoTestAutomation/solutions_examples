# The mapping datafile tells genie which connections to use and how to map them.
# Genie will connect to all connections specified in the mapping_datafile. If no
# mapping datafile is provided then it will use the cli connection by default.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Below is the schema which explains how the mapping works
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# devices:
#
#    <device name>: # Name of the device.
#                   # Can either be an alias or device hostname
#                   # as defined in the pyats testbed file.

#        mapping:
#
#            cli: # Which connection to use for Cli commands.
#            yang: # Which connection to use for Yang commands.
#            xml: # Which connection to use for xml commands.
#            rest: # Which connection to use for rest commands.
#            netconf: # Which connection to use for netconf commands.
#            gnmi: # Which connection to use for gnmi commands.
